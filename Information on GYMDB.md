LetsGetFit is a Gym, with many paying Members and Trainers. When Members sign-up they are given a 
choice of payment options, they can only choose one, however they may change this during the lifetime of 
the membership:
• Monthly
• Annually
• Quarterly
Each Member is issued with a Membership card, which contains a photo and unique membership number. 
When this card is presented the login date and time is recorded. When Members join the gym, they are 
assigned a Trainer to give them their own personalised training program. Normally these personalised 
training programs are updated every 6-8 weeks. Each Member can have many personalised training 
programs and work with many trainers. Each Trainer can set up many personalised training programs
Currently all this has been stored on paper, which has proven problematic, with personalised programs going 
missing along with Members details being misplaced.
They want to create a single database to consolidate all these details into one single source. The logical data 
model must be designed to meet 3NF (Third Normal Form) requirements. They want it to record all Member, 
Trainer, Program and Payment details at a minimum. It must be flexible enough to allow for changes such as 
Members or Trainer details. It must also lend itself to be used for marketing purposes, i.e. contacting current 
and old members with offers etc.
